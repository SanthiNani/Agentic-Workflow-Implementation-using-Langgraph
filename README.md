# Agentic-Workflow-Implementation-using-Langgraph
This project implements an agentic workflow using LangGraph, featuring a PlanAgent to decompose user queries into tasks and a ToolAgent that executes them using real tools like square root calculation, AI news scraping, and summarization. It returns accurate, human-readable results in a Streamlit-powered interface.
